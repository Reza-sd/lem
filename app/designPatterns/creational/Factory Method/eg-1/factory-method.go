/*
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In Go (Golang), you can implement the Factory Method pattern to provide flexibility in object creation without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

**Select statements in Go are inherently thread-safe.**

Here's why:

1. **Channel Operations:** Select statements primarily operate on channels, which are fundamental concurrency primitives in Go. Channels are designed to be thread-safe. The Go runtime ensures that operations on channels are atomic and synchronized, preventing race conditions.
2. **Goroutine Scheduling:** Goroutines, the lightweight threads of Go, are managed by the Go runtime. The runtime scheduler efficiently allocates and switches between goroutines, ensuring that select statements are executed in a fair and deterministic manner.
3. **Internal Synchronization:** The select statement itself is a language construct that is internally synchronized by the Go runtime. This means that even if multiple goroutines are executing select statements simultaneously, the runtime will ensure that they are processed in a safe and orderly manner.

**However, it's important to note that while select statements are thread-safe, the code within each case block might not be.** To ensure thread safety within a case block, you should use appropriate synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or channels to protect shared resources.

**Example of thread-safe use of select:**

```go
func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan int)
    ch2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        ch1 <- 42
    }()

    go func() {
        ch2 <- "hello"
    }()

    select {
    case v := <-ch1:
        fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", v)
    case v := <-ch2:
        fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", v)
    }
}
```

In this example, even if multiple goroutines are sending values to the channels, the select statement will ensure that only one case is executed at a time, preventing race conditions.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively use select statements to write concurrent and safe Go programs.
